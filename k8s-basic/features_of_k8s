feature of k8s:
following are the basic features of k8s.

Automatic bin packing :
service discovery and load balancing :
storage orch :
self healing :

1) Automatic bin packing:

Kubernetes automatic bin packing works by intelligently scheduling containers onto nodes in a cluster, taking into account factors such as resource requirements, utilization, and availability..
Bin packing is the process in k8s where this process will allocate the required resource to all the pod and nodes , form available resource with keeping all nodes in high availablity.


2) service discovery and load balancing :

K8s will create the services using combination of pods , each pods containes uniqe IP and storage and container inside it ,
for those service k8s assign the DNS name and do the load-balance acroos them.

with this system k8s will have control over the network and communication between pods and can do load balancing across them.

3) storage orch :Container reuires storage to store the data , pod can have a storage volumes.

this volumes will be shared in between all the conatainer inside the pod.

k8s allow us to select the volume form diff cloud providers like aws,azure,gcp,local storage.

4)self healing:
 K8s is having the self healing feature using which it will perfom below operation.

"if container fails - restarts container/recreate 
 if node dies  - replace and reschedule cont.
 if cont. does not respond to the user defined health check up- kill the cont."
